# ToDo project with TS.

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

### Q: What about this project?
After finished a course about TypeScript I started a simple ToDo project to practice what I've learned about topics like: 
*Types
*Typed
*Union types
*Function return
*Libraries that support TypeScript

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like [@snowpack/plugin-webpack](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/tree/main/plugins/plugin-webpack) or [snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle](https://github.com/ParamagicDev/snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle) to your `snowpack.config.mjs` config file.
